# Analog Decay

We spend so much effort digitizing the world. ADC (Analog to Digital Converters) are the gatekeepers of modern processing. We crave the clean, discrete 0s and 1s.

But the real world is messy. It's a continuous sine wave, not a square wave. Noise isn't just an error; it's information about the environment (thermal noise, electromagnetic interference).

In my recent work with operational amplifiers, I've come to appreciate the "decay". The way a capacitor discharges is a perfect exponential curve, defined by physics, not code. There is a truth in that curve that a digital approximation can only asymptotically approach, never truly touch.

# Efficiency Optimization in PWM-driven Municipal Lighting

**Abstract:**
This paper presents a novel approach to reducing energy consumption in urban lighting grids. By utilizing local sensing nodes rather than a centralized timer-based control, we demonstrate a potential energy saving of 40% in low-traffic residential zones.

## Introduction
Conventional street lighting operates on fixed schedules or ambient light sensors. This leads to significant energy waste during late-night hours when streets are empty.

## Methodology
We constructed a scale model utilizing high-efficiency LEDs driven by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The duty cycle of the PWM signal is functionally related to the distance of the nearest detected object, following an inverse-square law mapping to simulate natural illumination requirements.

## Results
Experimental data suggests that the idle power consumption can be reduced to <10% of peak power while maintaining safety standards for instant-on brightness when motion is detected.

## Conclusion
The proposed adaptive system offers a viable retrofit solution for existing lighting poles, requiring minimal infrastructure changes while offering substantial operational cost reductions.
